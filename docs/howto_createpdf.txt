Basics
------

* Run "make latex"
* Go to _build/latex
* Run "pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode XBeach" 3 times to fix all references

Troubleshoot
------------

Most likely the above will result in latex errors. The most common are:

* Everything after a certain image caption is ignored (images 15, 18, 19 and 22)
  * Solution: remove the \phantomsection\label{...} direction from the image caption
* Rendering of tabulary directive fails
  * Solution: remove white lines in "\textsf{\relax ... }" directive
* Table of contents is too short:
  * Solution: add "\setcounter{tocdepth}{2}" above "\tableofcontents" directive
* Long tables are rendered to a width greater than the page width
   * Solution: change the cell definition to:
     \begin{longtable}{|p{0.2\textwidth}
                       |p{0.4\textwidth}
                       |p{0.2\textwidth}
                       |p{0.1\textwidth}
                       |p{0.1\textwidth}|}
* Long tables are rendered to a length greater than the page height
  * Change the environment from "tabulary" to "longtable"
* Remove author
